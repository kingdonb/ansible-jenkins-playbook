aws-ec2-node
=========

My own EC2 node configuration for kube-single (not kube specific)

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: kube_master
      gather_facts: True
        roles:
          - aws-ec2-node
